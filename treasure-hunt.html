  <h1>Treasure Hunt</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Mango Hunt!</p>
  <p>This is the beginning of a long journey you will make through various forms of cryptography.
    You will need to be fluent in at least one coding language and have Photoshop and/or GIMP.
    Coding is not as necessary as GIMP.</p>
  <p>There will generally be two ways to advance levels.

One way is to click a button on the page. When you have done this, there will generally be a password on the page you travel to which you will get from the first level.

The other way is to change the URL directly. When you do this, there will usually not be a password on the resulting page.

Depending on what you see, make the best decision about what to do.

OK?

Okay.</p>
  <p><button  class="button" onclick="document.location = 'treasure-hunt/level-1.html'">Enter</button></p>
  <p>Note: Some levels use cookies to track how far you have gotten. This is only in the case of a password level, so that you do not have to re-enter the password.</p>
